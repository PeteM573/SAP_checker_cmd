# Command-Line SAP Transaction Checker
A command-line tool for testing mock export data for researching theoretical service part variances.
While this is *based on* the output of an SAP system, it does not use any proprietary information from my former employer. Just a receipt or repair number generated at random and SAP movement codes taken from SAP's own documentation.

Since I am connected to a number of Apple employees: DO NOT use this to actually do research! 
  1: It's working with incomplete mock data.
  2: It would be ridiculously stupid to just run a python script you found on GitHub to try to make variance research go faster.
  3: I'm purposefully not including a lot of things that a real Ops pro would make use of, because I want to prevent 2.

If someone at Apple wants to give me a ton of money to take this idea and make it actually functional, then I can be reached on linkedin. :p
